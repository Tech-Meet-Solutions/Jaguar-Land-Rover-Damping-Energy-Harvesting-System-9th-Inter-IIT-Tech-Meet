# DAMPING ENERGY HARVESTING SYSTEM- Jaguar Land Rover

This repository is a collection of files including simulations, literature review and presentation created by the IIT Bombay contingent for the Jaguar Land Rover Problem Statement of Damping Energy Harvesting System for Inter-IIT Tech Meet 9.0 by IIT Guwahati.

## Abstract
As the world is shifting towards renewable energies, low carbon foot prints, the inclination of automobile industry has already begun towards Electrification.However doing so gave rise to newer constraints like battery size, power savings, etc. Various mechanisms have been developed till date including regenerative braking, use of photovoltaic cells. Though these can be considered as discrete sources of regenerative energy, there is an entry on one mechanism, which can continuously provide regeneration. No wonder, it will revolutionize the market and automobile sector. This is DAMPING ENERGY HARVESTING SYSTEM!
